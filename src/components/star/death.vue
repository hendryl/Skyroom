          <h1>What Happens When A Star Is About To Die?</h1>
          <p>
            Stars do not live forever, although they look like they will stay forever, stars will eventually die and disappear into the darkness of space. On average, stars can live from a couple million years up to trillions of years depending on their mass. The age of a star mainly depends on the process of nuclear fusion. The age of a star mainly depends on the process of nuclear fusion. Hydrogen converts into helium produce energy and powers the stars. But once it use all of its hydrogen, the star will start undergoing some changes.
          </p>
          <P>
            Stars live mainly because of the fusion between hydrogen that create helium atoms. This process happens countless of times in the star's core every second and produce unimaginable number of energy. But after the star fuses all of its hydrogen, the helium atoms will build up in the core. If the pressure is big enough, the star can fuse helium atom into carbon until the carbon atoms build up and fuse into heavier elements. The main factor that determine a star's death is it mass. The low mass stars will die differently compared to the more powerful high mass star.

            Before we talk about the process of star's death, we must understand the process of nuclear fusion. In its early years, stars fuse hydrogen atom into helium but once the hydrogen runs out, then the star starts fusing helium into carbon. After the helium is out, carbon fuse into neon, magnesium, and sodium. Neon will fuse into magnesium and oxygen. Oxygen will fuse into silicon and the silicon fuse into iron. Once the star starts fusing iron, it'll lose energy and starts to die.

            In case of low mass star, the pressure it generates in its core is not strong enough to fuse heavier elements. Usually a low mass star can only reach fusion up to carbon. For stars that are smaller than the sun, they will fuse all of their hydrogen and once it is all gone, they lose energy and cool down until it becomes a cold dead star.

          <p>
            For stars that has a mass like the sun or a few times bigger, the pressure is greater in the core. Because of it, stars that have a mass a few times bigger than the sun will continue fuse helium into carbon. In this process the star's surface swell up to twice of its current size and its core keeps getting hotter. The core keeps contracting and heat up, until it becomes so hot that the outer layer swells even more and blow up from ten up to a hundred fifty times of its current size and becomes a super giant. After the star blows off its outer layer, what is left is just the dense hot core not much bigger than earth, which is called a white dwarf. The sun's outer layer becomes a planetary nebula and the White dwarf which cannot generate energy, will starts to cool in around ten million years.

            High mass stars on the other hand have a more spectacular and powerful way to die. For a star that has a mass of eight or more times the mass of the sun, it can continue fusing heavier elements in its core. Once the core starts fusing silicon into iron, the end has come for the star. After fusing iron, the core cannot produce energy to fuel the massive star and start losing energy. Once this happen, gravity starts pushing down and collapses the star to its core in a fraction of the speed of light and shrinking the star into a dozen of kilometers. In the same time, because of the force from the collapsing star push down to the core, it creates a huge shockwave and blast out the star outer layer, the whole star explodes. This explosion is called a supernova. A supernova is so powerful and so bright that it can be seen half across the universe. If the star has less than 20 times the sun's mass it will become a neutron star but if the star is more massive, the collapse will continue and it will become a black hole.

            Eventually all stars die, but the remains of dead stars becomes the most important thing to make life possible in the universe. The heavy element that we know today could not possibly exist if stars don't die and go supernova. Our body and everything we see around us was made deep inside the core of a star that's about to die. Sometimes we think that we and the rest of the universe are different and very distant, but to understand the very nature of the universe we could realize that we are part of the universe. We owe our existence from the stars that had died billions of years ago. We are the decendence of the stars and we have the previlege to explore the grand beauty and wonders of the universe so let's keep exploring.
